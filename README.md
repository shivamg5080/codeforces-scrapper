# codeforces-scrapper
Developed a web scraping project in Python to extract and save problem statements, notes, and inputs/outputs from Codeforces problem pages using Selenium and BeautifulSoup libraries.
Implemented a file management system to save different problem data in separate files with proper names, dates, and indentation.
Wrote a user-friendly command line interface to input problem URLs and check if the file exists and has content.
